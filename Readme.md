# OusbSD (On USB Screen Display)

This is a small application that displays the currently playing song on the Velleman k8101 USB Messageboard using their included library.

It currently doesn't do much but send the info to the screen on a button click.

## TODO
* [x] Create a background image
* [x] Find a way to run the send text routine on file change
* [x] Make system icon, exclusively use from there
* [ ] Allow pause using physical button
* [ ] Write how to use
