# OusbSD (On USB Screen Display)

**_My device no longer works, so I am unable to continue to ensure this works until I can get it functioning again. The display refuses to show, though I have reflowed all solder points._**


This is a small application that displays the currently playing song on the Velleman k8101 USB Messageboard using their included library.

It will automatically change when the text file from your music player plugin changes. Set up tutorial coming soon

## TODO
* [x] Create a background image
* [x] Find a way to run the send text routine on file change
* [x] Make system icon, exclusively use from there
* [ ] Allow pause using physical button (Might not be possible)
* [ ] Write how to use
* [ ] Make HiDPI compatible (looks blurry right now)
